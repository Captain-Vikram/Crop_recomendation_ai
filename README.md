# Crop & Afforestation Recommendation AI Bot

## Project Overview
The Crop & Afforestation Recommendation AI Bot is a Streamlit-based Python application designed to provide intelligent recommendations for native crops and tree species suitable for urban afforestation and agriculture in India. By leveraging real-time environmental data, the bot aims to enhance biodiversity, pollution control, and sustainability in urban settings.

## Features
- **Location-Based Recommendations**: Users can input their location via PIN code or GPS to receive tailored plant and crop suggestions.
- **API Integration**: The application aggregates data from multiple APIs, including soil, weather, air quality, and biodiversity information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the app offers an intuitive interface for easy interaction and clear output.
- **AI-Driven Suggestions**: Powered by the Gemini Pro API, the bot provides context-aware recommendations based on user goals and environmental conditions.
